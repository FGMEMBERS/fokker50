Fokker 50 Chronograph
=====================

This chronograph has 3 functions:
1)  Time of day (GMT)
2)  Flight time clock
3)  Stopwatch

The time of day is always displayed in the upper window in GMT.  This can be adjusted using the switch in the lower RH corner of the instrument.  The selectable positions of this switch are, from bottom to top- fast forward, hold, run.  Normally, the selector is in the run position, and is sprung loaded out of the forward position.

The flight time display is controlled with the selector in the lower LH corner.  Positions from bottom to top are- reset, hold, run.  The selector is sprung loaded out of the reset position.  The display is always is hours and minutes (00:00), but only when run has been selected after reset.

The CHR button in the top left corner starts, stops and resets the stopwatch.  The display is via the pointer, and the lower digital display in minutes.  This display overrides the lock when the stopwatch is running, and until the button is pressed to reset.  This means that the clock can be 'paused' to display the elapsed time.
The button is duplicated on the inboard side of the yoke.

The date button is not always present, is never used (to my knowledge!), and has been ommitted from my model.
